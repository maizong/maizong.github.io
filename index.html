<center><h1>Hi there!</h1></center>
<p>My name is Mai Zong and I am a third year undergraduate 
Life Sciences Communication major aspiring to be a digital 
marketer. I also am pursuing certificates in Digital Studies 
and Graphic Design.</p>
<img src="home.jpg" alt="A picture of Mai" style="width:750px">
<br>
<p>I create content for social media marketing and 
involve myself with photography. I'm currently seeking 
a skilled organization that will allow me to further 
increase my skills and knowledge in these fields!</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Something I've been working on...</h2>
<p>As an LSC major, I've mainly been focusing on social media, 
photography, and videography work. However, since around the good 'ol
middle school days, I've been interested in writing. Of course, I haven't 
been as crazy of a writer since those days, but I figured I'd create 
a blog where I could write in more of a casual and personal tone! 
Although I haven't posted in a while, check it out some time! </p>
