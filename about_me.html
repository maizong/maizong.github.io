<p>Hi (again)! My name is Mai Zong and I'm a third year 
undergraduate majoring in Life Sciences Communication. I'm 
also pursuing a certificate in Digital Studies and hope to 
work more in photography, videography, and social media work!</p>

<p>Regarding my work experience, I'm a social media manager 
AND sushi chef for Tavernakaya and Umami, both family-owned
Asian fusion restaurants located in the heart of Madison! My 
social media work involves daily content creation for the 
social media platforms, making necessary updates to the 
restaurant's website, and taking food photography.</p> 

<p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about photography. I love 
taking pictures of my plants, food, friends & family, and 
of course, my dog Natsu!</p> 

<p>Through my current social media management work, I've 
gained experience with Adobe Creative Suite's softwares, 
primarily inDesign, Lightroom, and PremierePro.</p> 

<p>When it comes to web design, I have basic experience in 
HTML, CSS. I also have experience using WiX, Squarespace, and 
Wordpress.</p>
